                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a variety of ways to play poker, that differ depending on how cards are added to play and how many cards each player
                    has in their hand. Below are three of the most popular types of poker and brief explanation of their rules:

                <p>
                    <strong>Texas Hold 'Em: </strong> The most popular and easiest to learn, Texas Hold 'Em is plaid with each player being delt two pocket cards and
                    can use any of the five communal cards to make a hand. It lasts four rounds of betting with communal cards added each round.<br /><br />
                    <strong>Omaha: </strong> Like Texas Hold 'Em, Omaha is plaid for four rounds with five communal cards, however in Omaha all the communal cards are
                    revealed at once. It also differs from the other versions as each player has four cards in their hand.<br /><br />
                    <strong>5-Card Draw: </strong> In 5-Card draw each player is dealt 5 cards and then is allowed to use three of the communal cards instead of the
                    cards they were originally dealt. <br /><br />
